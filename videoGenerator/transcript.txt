Layoffs: Google vs Meta?,
from r/csMajors, by u/ResidentTranslator43, 

Iâ€™ve heard around that Google has better job security. However, it seems that if you perform, you keep your job at Meta, while at Google you can get laid off even if you have good performance scores.

So which company is actually more predictable regarding whether you get laid off?
